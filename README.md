# Machine-Learning-for-Stock-Prices
For my senior design project at Miami University my team and I set out to try and develop a machine learning algorithm to advise and make stock investments. There were many parameters to consider such as investment amount, length and amount of risk. As well as how we measure that risk and determine probability of profit.

# Introduction

Ever since the stock market was founded, people have been trying to find a way to "beat" it. That is, correctly predict the future value to make a profitable investment. The stock market is essentially just an auction. Someone has a part of a company that they are willing to sell for a certain amount of money (ask price) and people want to buy that share for another amounr (ask price) and eventually the buyer wil buy at a price and that will become the new price for the stock. That is a very simple overview but with millions of transactions and millions of dollars going in and out of companies daily, it becomes hard to predict what the price will do. There is also a plethora of data ranging from stock charts to technical data such as moving averages or momentum oscillators. This data makes this problem a good starting point for a machine learning algorithm. 

# Machine learning 

Machine learning algorithms learn through experiementation. This process is called training. A normal algorithm follows a certain set of rules. If this then do this, else do something else. A machine learning algorithm improve these steps by themselves so that humans do not have to constantly update the algorithm. Machine learning has two main categories: Classification and regression. Classification is used for sorting data into groups or bins. An example of this is spam detection. This algorithm is trained on labeled data (supervised learning) and when it sees a new email it can classify it as spam or not spam. Regression is good for predicting a future characteristic or attribute of data. This makes this method a great tool for predicting stock prices. As mentioned above supervised learning is when we train the machine learning algorithm with labeled data and then feed it data that is unlabeled. With the existence of supervised learning hints to the existence of unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning is where we feed the algorithm data that is unlabeled in the training stage. This would be a good solution for our data because we don't have our data labeled however, regression relies on supervised learning. Thus, we will need to obtain some sort of labeled data or do some preprocessing ourselves to prep our data for the training stage.
