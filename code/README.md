## Code

This folder will contain jupyter notebooks as well as other python scripts that I used to construct and learn. Some files I will label with 
"trial #" please note that these files may not execute correctly. That is because there might be errors that were integral to the learning process so I documented them. I will post notes about each file here as I upload them.
