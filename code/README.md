## Code

This folder will contain jupyter notebooks as well as other python scripts that I used to construct and learn. Some files I will label with 
"trial #" please note that these files may not execute correctly. That is because there might be errors that were integral to the learning process so I documented them. I will post notes about each file here as I upload them.


## ML_trial3_withh_all_data

In this notebook, I simplify the model to have 2 layers of 15 neurons. These numbers were chosen at random but the preformance of the model wasn't that bad. 
The model's training loss eventaually went below 1, but the validation loss indicated an overfit model or a vanishing gradient problem. To fix these I will need to tweak the model a bit more.
